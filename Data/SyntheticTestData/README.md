## Synthetic data for testing and validating DIC and Continuity Metropolis

Generated with 'generate_data.py' and 'generate_field.py' in /CellFlowQPI/Code/SyntheticData.
Each folder contains:
- config.txt: configuration file
- _velocity_full.txt: full velocity field used to generate .tif files. This field covers a larger area than the final frames.
- /tif
- /plots
- /dic (remove this?)
